# Roadmap

The project continues to evolve through incremental MVPs. Upcoming milestones focus on richer context handling and AI assistance.

## MVP G – Context & Risk Awareness
- Incorporate contextual signals such as location, device posture, and time to refine authorization decisions.
- Evaluate risk levels and adapt policies dynamically.
- Expose configuration knobs to tune context weighting and risk thresholds.

## MVP H – AI-Assisted Policy Authoring
- Integrate AI helpers to suggest or generate policy rules from natural language prompts.
- Provide an interactive flow for reviewing and approving AI-generated policies before activation.
- Capture feedback to continuously improve policy suggestions.
