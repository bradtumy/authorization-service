# Contributing to Authorization Service

Thank you for considering a contribution to [tumy-tech-labs/authorization-service](https://github.com/tumy-tech-labs/authorization-service)! 
We follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and encourage constructive, respectful collaboration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fork & Local Setup
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork and set up the `upstream` remote:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/authorization-service.git
   cd authorization-service
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:tumy-tech-labs/authorization-service.git
   ```
3. Install Go, `golangci-lint`, Docker (optional) and project dependencies.

## üîÑ Staying Up to Date
- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Rebase your work on top of the latest upstream changes:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```
- Use a new branch for every story or bugfix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-task
  ```
- Rebase your branch often and push with `--force-with-lease` only to your personal branches:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main
  git push --force-with-lease origin feature/my-task
  ```

## üß™ Code Style, Linting & Tests
We use Go formatting conventions and `golangci-lint`. Run the following before committing:
```bash
go fmt ./...
golangci-lint run
make test # or go test ./...
```
Ensure all checks pass locally; continuous integration (CI) must pass before your pull request (PR) is merged.

## üîç Pull Requests
- Push your branch to your fork and [open a PR](https://github.com/tumy-tech-labs/authorization-service/compare) against `tumy-tech-labs/authorization-service`.
- Use a clear title (e.g., `feat:` or `fix:` prefix) and describe motivation, approach and testing in the body. Link related issues.
- CI must be green and at least one reviewer must approve before merging.
- Maintainers squash & merge only. Squash your commits or allow maintainers to do so.
